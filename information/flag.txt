Solution:
Whenever I get an image file, I go and run file (to make sure it's an image),
binwalk (to see if there are hidden files), 
strings and usually I pair that with grep  
lastly I check the image in a hexeditor, just to check the header and such.
aka. using " $ hexedit cat.jpg "
Interesting... I can see some base64, maybe?
W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d and cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9

Flag:
echo W5M0MpCehiHzreSzNTczkc9d | base64 -d
or 
echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d
